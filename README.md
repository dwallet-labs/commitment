# commitment
Traits for homomorphic commitment schemes, including Pedersen based implementations.
Includes implementation for hash-based non-homomorphic commitment using [`merlin::Transcript`]. 

# Security
We have gone through a rigorous internal auditing process throughout development, requiring the approval of two additional cryptographers and one additional programmer in every pull request.
That being said, this code has not been audited by a third party yet; use it at your own risk.

# Releases
This code has no official releases yet, and we reserve the right to change some of the public API until then.
